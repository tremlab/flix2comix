10	159643774X	9781596437746	Tamaki, Mariko	Jillian Tanmaki	First Second	This one summer	Every summer, Rose goes with her mom and dad to a lake house in Awago Beach. It's their getaway, their refuge. Rosie's friend Windy is always there, too, like the little sister she never had. But this summer is different. Rose's mom and dad won't stop fighting, and when Rose and Windy seek a distraction from the drama, they find themselves with a whole new set of problems. One of the local teens, just a couple of years older than Rose and Windy, is caught up in something bad... Something life threatening. It's a summer of secrets, and sorrow, and growing up, and it's a good thing Rose and Windy have each other.	-2	-2	-2	0	3	4	2
2	0871354365	9780871354365	Jodorowsky, Alexandro	\N	Epic Comics	The incal	John Difool, a low-class detective in a degenerate dystopian world, finds his life turned upside down when he discovers an ancient, mystical artifact called "The Incal." Difools adventures will bring him into conflict with the galaxys greatest warrior, the Metabaron, and will pit him against the awesome powers of the Technopope. These encounters and many more make up a tale of comic and cosmic proportions that has Difool fighting for not only his very survival, but also the survival of the entire universe.	-4	-3	4	-1	-3	-4	2
6	0375714693	9780375714696	Clowes, Daniel	\N	Pantheon	Ice Haven	Clowes (Ghost World) casts a harsh spotlight on the misfit dreamers who inhabit the small town of Ice Havenin this riveting graphic novel. Originally published in a somewhat different form as part of Clowes's occasional comic book Eightball, this piece finds Clowes moving beyond the withering satire of his earlier works to a more nuanced style. Readers will wince even as they feel sympathy for the self-deluded characters who reside in Ice Haven. Take narrator Random Wilder, writer of doggerel poetry. One would think it'd be easy to be the best poet in a place like Ice Haven, but Wilder has a rival, Ida Wentz, an old woman who likes to bake cookies. Wilder spends his spare time plotting against her. Ida's visiting granddaughter, Vida, also has literary yearnings, despite having sold zero copies of her fanzine. These and other oddballs play out their stories against the mysterious disappearance of a little boy named David Goldberg, whose possible murder recalls the Leopold and Loeb case.	-3	2	3	3	3	3	0
7	1897299753	9781897299753	Adrian Tomine	\N	Drawn and Quarterly	Shortcomings	Adrian Tomine draws his mid-twenties slackers with an impeccable, exact line for every slumpy gesture and cultivated rumple. In Shortcomings, he tackles a book-length comic for the first time after three collections of stories, and his maturity shows not so much in the ages of his characters, who are still slackly wandering, dropping out of grad school or managing a movie theater, but in his calm and masterful handling of his story, in which vividly individual characters wander through the maze of imposed and self generated stereotypes of Asian and American identities (the title is a wry allusion to one of the most enduring of those assumptions). Never has that old commonplace that the personal is the political seemed more paralyzing, and more true.	-3	1	-2	2	4	3	2
11	1906838429	9781906838423	Glyn Dillon	\N	SelfMadeHero	The Nao of Brown	Twenty-eight-year-old Nao Brown, who's hafu (half Japanese, half English), is not well. She's suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and fighting violent urges to harm other people. But that's not who she really wants to be. Nao has dreams. She wants to quiet her unruly mind; she wants to get her design and illustration career off the ground; and she wants to find love, perfect love. Nao's life continues to seesaw. Her boyfriend dumps her; a toy deal falls through. But she also meets Gregory, an interesting washing-machine repairman, and Ray, an art teacher at the Buddhist Center. She begins to draw and meditate to ease her mind and open her heart and in doing so comes to a big realization: Life isn't black-and-white after all . . . it's much more like brown.	-3	-2	1	3	3	-2	-2
4	1596430966	9781596430969	Emmanuel Guibert	\N	First Second	Alan's War	When Alan Cope joined the army and went off to fight in World War II, he had no idea what he was getting into. This graphic memoir is the story of his life during wartime, a story told with poignant intimacy and matchless artistry. Across a generation, a deep friendship blossomed between Alan Cope and author/artist Emmanuel Guibert. From it, Alan's War was born, a graphic novel that is a deeply personal and moving experience, straight from the heart of the Greatest Generation. A unique piece of WWII literature and a ground-breaking graphic memoir.	-4	-2	2	1	1	3	-1
9	0930289722	9780930289720	Kyle Baker	\N	Vertigo	Why I Hate Saturn	Cranky Columnist Anne Merkel is only happy when she's complaining...about her editors, about being single in New York City, about running out of Scotch. But when her long-lost sister shows up claiming to be Queen of the Leather Astro-Girls of Saturn, Anne's going to wish she'd never complained about anything...	-2	4	1	-3	-1	2	-2
13	0312384483	9780312384487	Yang, Gene	\N	Square Fish	American Born Chinese	A tour-de-force by rising indy comics star Gene Yang, American Born Chinese tells the story of three apparently unrelated characters: Jin Wang, who moves to a new neighborhood with his family only to discover that he's the only Chinese-American student at his new school; the powerful Monkey King, subject of one of the oldest and greatest Chinese fables; and Chin-Kee, a personification of the ultimate negative Chinese stereotype, who is ruining his cousin Dann's life with his yearly visits. Their lives and stories come together with an unexpected twist in this action-packed modern fable. American Born Chinese is an amazing ride, all the way up to the astonishing climax.	-3	-4	-2	-1	-2	-4	3
3	0375714723	9780375714726	Charles Burns	\N	Pantheon Books	Black hole	The prodigiously talented Burns hit the comics scene in the '80s via Raw magazine, wielding razor-sharp, ironic-retro graphics. Over the years his work has developed a horrific subtext perpetually lurking beneath the mundane suburban surface. In the dense, unnerving Black Hole, Burns combines realism, never a concern for him before, and an almost convulsive surrealism. The setting is Seattle during the early '70s. A sexually transmitted disease, the "bug," is spreading among teenagers. Those who get it develop bizarre mutations, sometimes subtle, like a tiny mouth at the base of one boy's neck, and sometimes obvious and grotesque. The most visibly deformed victims end up living as homeless campers in the woods, venturing into the streets only when they have to, shunned by normal society. The story follows two teens, Keith and Chris, as they get the bug. Their dreams and hallucinations, made of deeply disturbing symbolism merging sexuality and sickness, are a key part of the tale. The AIDS metaphor is obvious, but the bug also amplifies already existing teen emotions and the wrenching changes of puberty. Burns's art is inhumanly precise, and he makes ordinary scenes as creepy as his nightmare visions of a world where intimacy means a life worse than death.	-3	-4	2	4	3	-4	-3
1	0679406417	9780679406419	Spiegelman, Art	\N	Pantheon Books	Maus	Maus is a haunting tale within a tale. Vladek's harrowing story of survival is woven into the author's account of his tortured relationship with his aging father. Against the backdrop of guilt brought by survival, they stage a normal life of small arguments and unhappy visits. This astonishing retelling of our century's grisliest news is a story of survival, not only of Vladek but of the children who survive even the survivors. Maus studies the bloody pawprints of history and tracks its meaning for all of us.	-3	2	4	4	2	4	-3
8	1401204953	9781401204952	Morrison, Grant	Frank Quitely	Vertigo	WE3	Writer Grant Morrison and artist Frank Quitely deliver the emotional journey of WE3, three house pets weaponized for lethal combat by the government, as they search for "home" and ward off the shadowy agency that created them. With nervous systems amplified to match their terrifying mechanical exoskeletons, the members of Animal Weapon 3 (WE3) have the firepower of a battalion between them. But they are just the program's prototypes, and now that their testing is complete, they're slated to be permanently "decommissioned," causing them to seize their one chance to make a desperate run for freedom. Relentlessly pursued by their makers, the WE3 team must navigate a frightening and confusing world where their instincts and heightened abilities make them as much a threat as those hunting them, but a world, nonetheless, in which somewhere there is something called "home."	-4	-3	-3	2	-4	3	0
5	1770460209	9781770460201	Ware, Chris	\N	Drawn and Quarterly	Lint: Acme Novelty Library #20	The latest entry in Ware's roughly annual Acme Novelty Library is devoted to a heretofore peripheral figure in his ongoing "Rusty Bown" saga, Jordan Lint, who appeared briefly in earlier installments as a school bully. Here Ware chronicles nothing less than Lint's entire life in a series of single-page vignettes, from a newborn who sees the world in the form of benday dots to his troubled childhood, stormy adolescence, and failures as husband, father, and businessman, right up to his eventual death. Ware uses a wide palette of graphic devices isolated words, symbolic objects, and near-subliminal flashbacks, to convey Lint's inner thoughts and hidden turmoil. The assertive Lint seems a departure from Ware's typically hapless and passive protagonists, but he shares many of their traits, from a damaging early trauma to a near-spiritual attachment to a childhood home. And Ware's formal mastery of the medium continues to astonish. While he uses his characteristic techniques, meticulous drawing; tiny, repetitive panels ingeniously juxtaposed; creative typography [Gto brilliant effect, here he adds to his arsenal with a powerful sequence depicting a harrowing experience that happened to Lint's son, rendered in a primitive scrawl that's all the more powerful for its radical break with Ware's usual detached approach.	-4	-2	3	3	4	4	-2
12	177046218X	9781770462182	Craig Thompson	\N	Drawn & Quarterly	Blankets	Blankets is the story of a young man coming of age and finding the confidence to express his creative voice. Craig Thompson's poignant graphic memoir plays out against the backdrop of a Midwestern winterscape: finely-hewn linework draws together a portrait of small town life, a rigorously fundamentalist Christian childhood, and a lonely, emotionally mixed-up adolescence. Under an engulfing blanket of snow, Craig and Raina fall in love at winter church camp, revealing to one another their struggles with faith and their dreams of escape. Over time though, their personal demons resurface and their relationship falls apart. It's a universal story, and Thompson's vibrant brushstrokes and unique page designs make the familiar heartbreaking all over again. This groundbreaking graphic novel, winner of two Eisner and three Harvey Awards, is an eloquent portrait of adolescent yearning; first love (and first heartache); faith in crisis; and the process of moving beyond all of that. Beautifully rendered in pen and ink, Thompson has created a love story that lasts.	-4	-2	-1	-2	3	2	1
