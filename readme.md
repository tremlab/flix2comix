_____

flix2comix is a web app to help grownups who have never read a comic before, find a graphic novel suited to their tastes by rating a few movies.

You can visit my deployed app at Heroku: [flix2comix.herokuapp.com](https://flix2comix.herokuapp.com/)

This project was developed over a four week period during my time at Hackbright Academy (a coding bootcamp).
